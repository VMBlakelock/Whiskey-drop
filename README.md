# Whiskey-drop
Bootstrap 1st example

Working hard on this Whiskey Drop project

Information
We created the landing page for Whiskey Drop using a guided tutorial with video and text.
The tools used in the project were HTML and Bootstrap component. I.e - Grids, Table.

Images
We added 2 images from the web to show the people who quoted the service

I did have a problem here though. I couldnt understand how on the code institute video the tutor just added a images folder and added the images.
However I managed to somehow realise that I needed to download the images to my desktop, they add them to my repositortyin GITHUB.
It was then when i tried to push my new updated code the teminal advised I needed to pull the images through first then re git add, re git push
However my links are still notshowing in the browser - I have yet to work that out!
